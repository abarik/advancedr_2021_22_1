# Introduction

Welcome to the second book in R Fundamentals series! This second book takes you through how to do manipulation of tabular data and how to create modern graphics in R. We’ll primarily be using capabilities from the set of packages called the tidyverse within the book. The book is aimed at beginners to R who understand the basics (check out the [Basic R](https://abarik.github.io/basicr_2020_21_2/)).
